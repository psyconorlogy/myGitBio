- 👋 Hi, I’m @wordsurgeon, I like programming (Java, C++, Python) and I hope to make some cool stuff with y'all.
- 👀 I’m interested in building a future that empowers people to make the best decisions possible, by creating the best tools possible.
- 🌱 I am currently learning about computational neuroscience and physics. Simulating reality in a machine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas of all sorts. As long as I have the time (I do).
